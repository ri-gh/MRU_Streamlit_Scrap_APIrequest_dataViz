#Scrapping , dashboard ,dataviz , API request, deployment :

Here is a web app code I did in order to improve my skills in python programming,

The idea was to propose a dashboard with weather infos on several cities of Mauritius,

Then to show the evolution of the weather within the next 8 days there,

Eventually, find the best hotel location in each city regarding booking.com users review.

You'll find scrapping with Scrapy, API request, datavisualization using Plotly Express

Streamlit to make my dashboard, Docker & Heroku to deploy the app on the web...

You'll need to have 3 .py files in order to be able to run your Scrapy spiders (due to multhreading issues with Streamlit).

'config.toml'  file is the streamlit configuration file
